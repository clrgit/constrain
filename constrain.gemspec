    Allows you check if an object match a class expression. It is typically
    used to check the type of method paraameters. It is an alternative to using
    Ruby-3 .rbs files but with a different syntax and only dynamic checks
    
    Typically you'll include the Constrain module and use #constrain to check
    the type of method parameters:

      include Constrain

      # f takes a String and an array of Integer objects. Raise a Constrain::Error
      # if parameters doesn't have the expected types
      def f(a, b)
        constrain a, String
        constrain b, [Integer]
      end

    Constrain works with ruby-2 (and maybe ruby-3)
