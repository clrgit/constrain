o A constrain_class method that allows for inherited-from tests
o Allow single-argument boolean expressions: 'constrain !a.empty?'
o This seems to cause a stack error: 'constrain some-hash, Symbol'
o Allow range as value expressions. And REs!
o Use | to create class-or expressions
  o Class | Class syntax
  o Will solve problem with [String, Integer] as a String/Integer vs. An array
    of strings and integers
o Use & to construct tuple expressions
  o Class & Class (doesn't look good - maybe Class + Class ?)
  o Alt: A tuple method: "Symbol => constrain.tuple(String, Integer)"
o Better error message for 'constrain EXPR'
o Explain that 'constrain EXPR' can be used for 'constrain SomeClass < AnotherClass'
o Match ranges and regular expressions
o An array and hash method: "Symbol => constrain.array(Integer), String => constrain.hash(Symbol, Integer)"
  Nope. Solved by | syntax
o Constrained attributes: constrain_reader, constrain_writer, constrain_accessor: 
o Messages should include info about the unexpected element type in arrays (and
  maybe more): "Expected [#<PgGraph::Data::Record:public.pings[1] {id: 1, name:
  'Ping A'}>, #<PgGraph::Data::Record:public.pings[2] {id: 2, name: 'Ping B'}>,
  nil] to match [PgGraph::Data::Record]

+ constrain value, class-expr, "Error message"
+ Check against values: 'constrain arg, :one_value, :another_value, 1, 2, 3'
+ Allow 'constrain EXRP'
